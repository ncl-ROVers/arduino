# Arduino code 2020-21

## Overview

Low-level software for the Newcastle University ROV 2021. Takes key:value pairs from [Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/ncl-ROVers/raspberry-pi) in MsgPack format and acts on them accordingly.

Designed for Arduino Nano 33 BLE but should also be fully functional for Arduino Mega 2560 or similar.

## Installation

### Software Dependencies

You need to install the following libraries in your IDE:

- ArduinoJson
- Servo

### Identification

Arduino A and Arduino B have different pin assignments as shown below. By default, the code assumes it is running on Arduino A. To switch it to Arduino B, connect pin 17 to GND.

### Device keys and pin allocation

Thrusters are given an ID which describes their position on the ROV. Motors are named in a similar fashion.

## Development

### Overview 

The arduino runs arduino-main.ino which imports from the src directory. In terms of structure, the most interesting parts are in the equipment directory. Each device which could be connected has its own class.

- Input devices (i.e. sensors) inherit functionality from the Input class.
- Output devices (i.e. thrusters, motors) inherit functionality from the Output class. 
    - Anything which was using the BlueRobotics PWM controlled motors, including all thrusters and arm motors, has been derived from the EscMotor class.

This code is ultimately the third iteration of the [2018-19 Arduino code](https://github.com/ncl-ROVers/ROV-2018-19/tree/master/arduino-master).

### Mapper

A lot of the code is structured around the Mapper class. This class acts in a broadly similar way to a Java Hashmap. It has key:value pairs where the key is a string (the JSON ID of that device) and the value is an object which inherits from either Input or Output.

### Control of motors

All motors in this implementation are the Blue Robotics T100/T200/M100 which are controlled via PWM.
Each of these classes inherits from the EscMotor class, which in turn inherits from Output.
You set the speed of the motor using the setValue() method. For these motors it will take values in the range 1100-1900, where 1500 is stopped.
Devices are controlled when an associated key:value pair is received from the Pi.

### Reading of sensors

Sensors all inherit from the Input base class. You can read the sensor value from the getValue() method, and set any attributes of that sensor with setParam().
Sensors are polled once per loop.
